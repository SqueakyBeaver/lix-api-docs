Restyle of Lix's doxygen docs using [doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css)

## Directories
`src/` -- The files used to generate this. Plop these files into Lix's `doc/internal-api` directory and build the internal-api-docs
`docs/` -- The 8 bajillion output files. Do not open this directory. You will regret it.

TODO:
 -[] use a release version of doxygen-awesome-css
